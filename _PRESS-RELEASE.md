# Are They Poppin' Doe? #

## Heading ##
  > Are They Poppin'?

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This product is geared towards music lovers who are curious as to whether or not their favorite artist is actually (from an objective, data-driven stance) popular.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  > This product allows users to see their favorite artist's popularity rating in a fun, visually unpleasing format. If their favorite artist is popular, they're poppin'. If their favorite artist is not poppin', a list of related artists who have higher popularity ratings will be shown. Users will also have the ability to add an artist to their favorites, whatever their popularity rating may be (follow your heart!).

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  > My product solves the petty argument between close friends who argue over whether or not Taylor Swift or Beyonce had the greatest album of all time once and for all (unless their popularity changes).

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

## Quote from You ##
  > "Popularity may be subjective, but in this case... it's not." - Joe

## How to Get Started ##
  > All you have to do is grab artist data from the Spotify API and be able to search through artists to get started. The data comes in the form of artist objects with a popularity rating property already present!

## Customer Quote ##
  > "Wow! I had the greatest time searching for artists and seeing their popularity rating. It was the best 30 seconds I've ever spent." - Bob

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > The choice to work with Spotify's API was one I had been wanting to do for a long time. I hope you enjoy my attempt at using artist data in an unusual way! Check out my github (josephsanglee) if you'd like to view more of my projects in the future!
